                        Author, Architect, Trainer & Tech Evangelist
                    </div>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">As a seasoned Principal Architect, I have been recognized for spearheading major technological transformations in several prestigious organizations. 
                        In the realm of cloud computing and security, my contributions as an author have gained notable recognition, with one of my books being honored as the 8th best cloud computing book of all time in 2020. 
                        My published works are widely available on respected platforms like O'Reilly, Amazon, Packt, Cloudericks.com and SecDops.com. 
                    </p>

                    <p>In my current role at Trainso, I am spearheading the strategic transition from a conventional training-centric approach to a leading position in cloud-based software solutions. 
                        My career trajectory has been marked by key roles, including Vice President at Morgan Stanley and Principal Architect at Societe Generale, where I played a vital role in cloud migration and modernization. 
                        At VMware, I expanded my scope from hands-on development to architecture, culminating in leading the public cloud governance team in India and overseeing all public cloud operations. 
                        My experience at Software AG was instrumental in deepening my expertise in the integration domain and core development skills, complementing my diverse professional journey that also includes significant roles at IG Group, SAP Ariba, and TCS.
                    </p>

                    <p>With over 15 professional certifications, including Microsoft Certified Architect Expert and Microsoft Certified DevOps Expert, my technical expertise covers a wide array of technological areas. 
                        I am committed to sharing this knowledge, actively speaking at various technical forums such as Google's Kubernetes Meetup, Java User Group, Elasticsearch meetup, and the Agile India Conference.
                    </p>

                    <p>Beyond my technical endeavors, I have a deep passion for writing and training. 
                        In my personal life, I enjoy traveling with my family, exploring new culinary experiences, and sharing these adventures through my blog. 
                        As an avid reader of both technical and non-technical books, and as a fan of crime dramas, I hold aspirations to one day channel my creativity into writing a techno-fiction thriller.

                            <p>  As the Principal Architect and Director at Trainso, I spearhead the company's strategic evolution from primarily a training-focused organization to a leader in cloud-based solutions, with a particular emphasis on developing software for training and membership management solutions. 
                                My responsibilities include the design and development of innovative cloud solutions that precisely meet the specific requirements of training and membership management, integrating advanced identity and access management to assure both security and operational efficiency. 
                                My commitment at Trainso is to revolutionize the fields of training and membership management with state-of-the-art cloud technologies, placing a strong emphasis on creating secure and high-performance systems. Furthermore, these practical, real-world systems provide a unique opportunity for Trainso's students and interns to gain hands-on, real-world experience, transcending beyond theoretical learning or simple sample projects.

As a key figure in the infra team at Morgan Stanley, I not only led the team in India but also collaborated across global teams to ensure a cohesive approach in our cloud migration and infrastructural development efforts.

As part of this role, I need to apply technical knowledge and insights to create a modernization roadmap for different business teams. I architect solutions to meet business and IT needs, ensuring technical viability of new projects and successful deployments, while orchestrating key resources and infusing key Infrastructure technologies (e.g. Windows and Linux IaaS, Security, Networking, etc.), and Application Development and DevOps technologies (e.g. App Service, containers, serverless, cloud native, etc.) as appropriate.</p>

The platform is completely onto Azure cloud and we are building an end-to- end solution. Unlike my primary role as an architect, here I get involved in hands on coding, interacting with other stakeholders outside company and work closely with leadership team within Societe Generale. I also occasionally take knowledge sharing sessions to people with special abilities which I believe has helped me create better accessibility designs.</p>

                    <p>Apart from being a software engineer, I enjoy writing and teaching. I have published two books on cloud compputing titled Serverless Programming Cookbook and AWS Security Cookbook, and they are available on all major platforms including Packt, Amazon and Oreilly.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">When I am not working with or writing about technollogy, I like to travel and eat good food with family, and write all about them in my blog. I read a lot of non-technical books and also watch some good crime drama in TV. I am hoping to write a techno-fiction thriller soon.</p>
